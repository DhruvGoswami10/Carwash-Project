#### Description:

AUTOBROS CAR STUDIO is an online E-Commerce website for car washing business. You can visit the website, select from the range of services, select from the available time slot and book a car wash at the comfort of your home.

The website is fully responsive and functional. You can add your desired items to the cart and edit the selected items from the cart page and proceed to checkout. Or if you change your mind you can clear the cart and go back to home to browse.

The website is made using vanilla javascript, HTML and CSS. I also used bootstrap elements to enhance the look of the website.

I have used navbar with 3 links and a dropdown menu from the bootstrap. The first link is the brand name itself which will
lead you to the home page of the website. Next is About Us section containing the details of this final project, you can surely
change it to make it actual about us section for an actual car washing company. Next is contact us section where you will find my contact details of my socials, since I am the current owner.

The dropdown menu exapnds giving us 3 diffrent links to washing, detailing and extras page. Following at the very end of the navbar is cart logo which reads "0" as there are zero items in the cart.

You can visit any of the pages from the sevices dropdown menu and choose the services by pressing add to cart button. You will notice that the item has been added to cart when the value of cart changes from "0" to 1 or 2 or 3 so on....

In the cart page at the top you will see the total amount in INR I choose INR because I am from INDIA. below total amount you will see "checkout" button in green color and "clear cart" button in red color. Below that you will see the list of cards of the selected items that can be increased or decreased in terms of quantity or can be removed all together.

The layout of the cards is in such a way that on the left side you will see the image and on the right side you will see all the information such as: Name of the item, it's price, quantity, and total price of that particualr item. You can adjust the quantity of the item by pressing green "+" or red "-" buttons.

To remove an Item you have 2 ways, you can either remove it by pressing the red "-" button and bringing the quantity value to 0 or by pressing red "x" button which will remove the whole card completely.

As you increase/ decrease the quantity of the item you will see that the price of that particular item increases/decreases accordingly and this will also effect the final price at top.

To maintain security and malicious practice of the user who can change the value of items from the developer tools I have made sure such things does not happen when programming the website in the script section.

Well, that was my CS50x final project!
